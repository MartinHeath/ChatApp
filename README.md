# ChatApp
Simple java based Websocket chat application. Built with Maven.
Uses jQuery and Bootstrap in front-end implementation and the basic Spring MVC model, Spring Boot, STOMP.js and Sock.js in backend.

This tutorial was used as a [base][l1] for the app:

### Installation (I think):
* Unrar package
* Read pom.xml with IDE, Netbeans for example.
* *Be sure to check the java version in pom.xml!*
* build into .jar.

### Version
0.1

### Tech

ChatApp uses the following:
* [Spring Boot] - easy configuration
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - UI style
* [jQuery] - functions and dynamic html
* [Stomp] - Message protocol
* [Sock] - Client node
* [Maven]
* [Spring]

### Installation

Requires java to run.

* Unrar package
* Read pom.xml with IDE, Netbeans for example.
* *Be sure to check the java version in pom.xml!*
* build into .jar.


### Run
* Use IDE to run App class,
* or simply use java -jar  /sourcefolder/chatApp.jar to start server.

Server should be running on localhost:8080.
No database is necessary in this version.

## Notes:

To use the app, give it a name (a blank input field will not be accepted) and start chatting.
To open a private chat, write the name of the user in the discussions area and add them when ready. This will open the chat.
A chat will be opened for the recipient as soon as you start messaging.
